# YTMonster Viewer Client for VPS 

Project created with Python 3 and Selenium, optimized for run forever on cheap Linux VPS.
You can use multiple accounts same time, just add more credentials, and script will run all of them same time, with very cheap VPS I suggest not to use more than 3 accounts same time

# Setup

Run "install.sh" with root privileges (in future you need to download the newest version of geckodriver - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
Add your logins and passwords to credentials.csv

# Usage:

Run "main.sh" and thats all.
It will restart all scripts every hour, and clear browser cache
